Description: Customizable Weather Plasmoid (CWP)
 This is another weather plasmoid.
 .
 It aims to be highly customizable, but a little harder to setup than other
 weather plasmoids. Nearly any weather forecast provider can be used,
 as long as the data is provided as html files (no flash).
 .
 The information how to extract the information from these html files is
 stored inside xml files. Commands like grep, head, tail, sed, awk, ... will
 do this job.
