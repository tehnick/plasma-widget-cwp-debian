Upstream-Name: Customizable Weather Plasmoid (CWP)
Upstream-Author: Georg Hennig <georg.hennig@web.de>
Original-Source: http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/?content=98925
 Site KDE-Look.org gives only disgusting way to get files. So we can use another
 tarball from the same author (see debian/watch file).
 .
 The orig.tar.bz2 is generated from upstream gzipped tarball, except it uses
 bzip compression and correct directory name. See section get-orig-source
 in debian/rules file for details.
